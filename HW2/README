Compile:
   Type 'make' and all codes will be compiled.

Optional messages:
   You can choose to what extent should messages should be showed.
   In 'Makefile', the argument DEBUG in CFLAGS controls the debug level.
   By default (not assigned, and -O3), DEBUG=0 and no other except ranking
   will be shown.
   If CFLAGS assigns DEBUG (can be 1, 2, 3, or 4), the more that value, the
   more messages will be shown, which will be output to stderr.
